                Utilize a subset of CSG’s Ascendon API to create your own unique entertainment experience application. Our API will allow you to browse categories of preconfigured movies and television shows, search for the details of particular products and even provide the metadata necessary to play trailers of the movies. We want to see your creativity and ingenuity in what you can do with this data. Some suggestions include creating a unique browsing experience, integrating with another site such as IMDB or RottenTomatoes for user ratings, overlaying the ability to create a “watchlist” or integrating with social media. Your creation must use our API to be eligible for our prizes but beyond that the uniqueness, creativity and coolness of UX will be what we will be rating entries on.
